Hi, Iâ€™m Joseph. I am an aspiring full stack developer seeking to strengthen my skills and knowledge of web development. I am currently completing my mentorship with Revature while simultaneously pursuing my undergratuate degree, in hopes of acquiring my masters degree someday. I have always been fascinated by technology and the internet since I first laid my hands on a keyboard at age 7. Eventually I would render HTML pages on MySpace as a hobby at age 15, and would soon go on to study programming in college. My goal is to use web development in a way that promotes the needs of a business while simultaneously having a positive impact on society and our environment.
